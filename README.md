# Melon - Room Reservation System

A simple, user friendly room reservation system

## Background

I used to work at a library that used an Excel sheet to track who had a reservation for the study rooms. 

We'd run into conflicts almost every single day when an employee would forget to refresh the excel sheet before making a reservation, and accidentally overwrite an existing reservation. 

The kicker? The library system had a subscription to a software suite that included a room reservation system that we could have used instead, but that software was so poorly designed that the excel sheet was the preferable option. 

Since that time, I've had a vision of an online room reservation system that actually has the end user in mind. 

Melon is my solution. Making room reservations simple and sweet.
